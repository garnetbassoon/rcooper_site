					<blockquote>
						<p>"I had the pleasure of being coached by Ron, aka The Word Doctor, when I was relatively new to the PR
					side of the communications business. He gave several training sessions to our group that were invaluable to our writing careers, as well as being very enjoyable. Most professionals today would certainly benefit from a good shot of training from the Doc in order to sound, well... professional."</p>
						<cite>Leslie Frye, Realtor<sup>&reg;</sup></cite>
				</blockquote>
					<blockquote>
					<p>"Ron Cooper has written several key articles for the Rodes Fashion Forum magazine where we needed the skills of an outside writer with a unique perspective. As a trained writer, Ron offers a range of talents that enables him to project to our clients, today's business executives, the  professional touch needed to capture the readers.</p>
					<p>The first things you think about when hiring a writer are professionalism, confidence, empathy and persuasiveness. That is what I received from Ron's in-depth works, and I would highly recommend him for any writing project."</p>
					<cite>Fred Teale, Director of Advertising, Rodes clothiers</cite>

He wrote press releases, dealt with members of the media, and worked closely with our clients to bring them into the most favorable light possible. I would highly recommend Ron to any one in need of media or PR services."</p>
