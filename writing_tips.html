						   <h2>Website copy—keep it fresh and grammatically correct!</h2>
						</header>
						<p><strong>Looked at your website lately? What kind of impression are you leaving your website visitors?</strong></p>
						<p>You might be surprised at what you find. Misspellings, incorrect word usage and grammatical errors are common on even the best websites.<p>
						
						<p> A Stanford University study, the “Web Credibility Project,” found that typos are one of the top 10 factors reducing a site’s credibility. It’s not a far stretch to conclude that loss of credibility means potentially lost business.<p>

						<blockquote>“…the findings suggested that typographical errors have roughly the same negative impact on a website’s credibility as a company’s legal or financial troubles,” according to the study.</blockquote>
		
						<p>Here’s my five-step action plan to correct and freshen up your web copy.</p>
									<ol>
								<li> Cut and paste all of your website copy and run it through a spell-check and grammar check. As you catch the misspellings, you’ll find places where some rewording is in order.</li>
								<li>Assign at least two people to read all Web text. You may consider hiring an experienced proofreader or copywriter to bring a fresh pair of eyes to your site.</li>
								<li>Check for consistency of messaging and tone and ensure the text is clear and concise.</li>
								<li>Check for industry jargon; too much of that could be a big turn-off for non-technical people who visit your site.</li>
								<li>Be aware of homophones (its versus it’s, their versus they’re) and use the correct word. Homophones are very, very common on websites.</li>
							</ol>	
						<p>Think of your website as your window to the world. You want it to accurately reflect who you are and what you’re all about. Your website should be letter-perfect, presenting a professional image for your company!</p>

								<h2>The Word Doctor’s "3 B’s of better writing"</h2>
								
							</header>
							<p>English is hard enough. However, when folks abroad mess it up, it can have hilarious results.</p>
								<ul>
									<li>A sign at a Paris hotel read: “Please leave your values at the front desk.”</li>
									<li>In Bangkok, a dry cleaners directed customers to “Drop your trousers here for best results.”</li>
									<li>And a Copenhagen airline ticket office promised: “We take your bags and send them in all directions.”</li>
								</ul>	
							<p>Is your writing getting “lost in translation?” Are you conveying your message in the clearest possible terms? I’ve developed the “3 B’s of Better Writing” to help ensure your writing will be understood and appreciated.</p>
								<ol>	
									<li><strong>Be brief.</strong> In a world of tweets, our attention span is shrinking. Write short. Try to limit your sentences to 10-15 words and your paragraphs to two or three sentences. Identify your core messages and stick to them.</li>
									<li><strong>Be clear.</strong> Clarity comes with good planning and organization. Write a rough outline before you begin writing. I like to scratch mine out on notebook paper. Simply list your key words or central ideas in bullet points. Think of your outline as made of clay, not stone. Shape and reshape your outline as you write the first and subsequent drafts of your piece.</li>
									<li><strong>Be compelling.</strong> Make your reader sit up and take notice. Draw him into your message. Write in a way that will command attention. As author Anton Chekhov urged, “Don’t tell me the moon is shining; show me the glint of light on broken glass.”</li>
								</ol>	
							<p>Plain language should be your goal. As Professor Robert Eagleson, an internationally famed linguist, writes so convincingly:</p>

								<blockquote>“Plain English is clear, straightforward expression, using only as many words as are necessary. Writers of plain English let their audience concentrate on the message instead of being distracted by complicated language.”</blockquote>

							<p>Use plain English, writing briefly, clearly and compellingly. It will pay off and reduce your risk of getting lost in translation!</p>
